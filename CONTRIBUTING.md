First off, thank you for considering contributing to cy-shadow-report. It's people like you that make cy-shadow-report such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the cy-shadow-report Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to cy-shadow-report@petermsouzajr.com.

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

cy-shadow-report is actively developed and we are here to help! If you have a question or are unsure if the issue you're experiencing is a bug, please search our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/petermsouzajr/cy-shadow-report/issues) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/[cy-shadow-report]) to see if it has already been reported or answered.

If your question or issue is not addressed yet, feel free to open a new issue.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to cy-shadow-report? Here are a few ways you can get started:

1. #### Look Through Existing Issues:

   - [Beginner issues](https://github.com/petermsouzajr/cy-shadow-report/issues?q=label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
   - [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/petermsouzajr/cy-shadow-report/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

2. #### Create a New Issue:

   - Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/petermsouzajr/cy-shadow-report/issues) if you identify a problem or an enhancement that isn't already reported. Newly created issues will automatically receive a `needs triage` label.

3. #### Claiming an Issue:
   - Issues with the `needs triage` label are not ready to be claimed. They require further refinement by project maintainers.
   - To claim an issue that doesnâ€™t have the `needs triage` label, simply add the comment `.take` on that. If the issue is unassigned, it will be automatically assigned to you through a custom github action.

### Local Development

To run module tests locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Run the module tests using `npm test`.

These steps will help you set up the project environment and ensure that your contributions do not break existing functionalities.

### Local Triggering of Main Functionality

To locally test and trigger the main functionality of this project, follow the steps outlined below.

#### Prerequisites

- Follow the setup guide to get Google Credentials. See [README](https://github.com/petermsouzajr/cy-shadow-report/blob/main/README.md#prerequisites).
- You may also need a test data file. This is the Cypress test results file compiled during Cypress runs. To create this test data file, you may need to switch to the `demo` branch and install dependencies. Then, run the Cypress tests and allow the run to finish so a compiled file can be created. After the run is complete, the file containing necessary test data can be found in `cypress-example/cypress/results/output.json`.

#### Steps

1. From the root of the repository, run `node cli.js`. This script is the entry point for the application's main functionality, and allows Options and Flags e.g. `node cli.js monthly-summary --duplicate`.
2. Observe the spreadsheet for report results.

This should give you the same result as if the package was installed or run from the `demo` branch.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain cy-shadow-report's quality.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible cy-shadow-report.
- Enable a sustainable system for cy-shadow-report's maintainers to review contributions.

Here's how to get started:

- **Working with Branches:** Please note that `main` and `demo` are protected branches. You must fork this repository, create a new branch in your fork, and then push your branch to our repository.
- **Target Production Branch:** Once your branch changes are approved, they will be integrated into the appropriate target production branch, either `main` or `demo`.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Do not begin working on an issue until you have been assigned that issue, either by manual assignment or by commenting `.take` on an unassigned issue (as described in [Claiming an issue](#claiming-an-issue)).
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Follow the established styles in the project or refer to [styleguide](#styleguides) for styling clarification.
4. Fill in the necessary details indicated by the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when you submit your pull request.
5. Verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing after submitting your pull request.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Contributors are encouraged, but not required, to use this format:

  - Prepend commit title with one of the Work Type indicators (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`)
  - Example: `git commit -m "Feat: Title of the commit" -m "Description or second line of the commit message. This line is optional with the intention of adding more detail and context to the change."`

- Keep in mind, your logs and commit messages will live on. If you need more tips on writing commit messages, check out the freeCodeCamp article, ["How to Write Commit Messages that Project Maintainers Will Appreciate"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-commit-messages-maintainers-will-like/) happy coding!

### JavaScript Styleguide

- All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).
- Use ES6 syntax.
- Include JSDoc comments for any function, class, or module you add.
- Avoid platform-dependent code.

### Testing Styleguide

- All new features must be accompanied by Jest tests.
- Write tests that cover core functionalities and edge cases.
- Ensure tests are reproducible and run consistently.
- Follow test-driven development (TDD) practices when applicable.
